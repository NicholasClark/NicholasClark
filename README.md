### My projects:

- 🧬 [iPAS (integrative Pathway Activity Signatures)](https://github.com/NicholasClark/iPAS/) - A method for construction of transcriptional signatures that are broadly predictive of signaling pathway perturbation in cancer cell lines. Our method combines data from many cell lines to create "ensemble" signatures with improved performance. [Pre-print](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.03.494712) available on BioRxiv and R package available [https://github.com/NicholasClark/iPAS/](here).
- 🧫 [iLINCS](http://www.ilincs.org/) - A web portal for analyzing transcriptional data using perturbation signatures from the [LINCS project](https://lincsproject.org/). Published in Nature Communications [Pilarczyk et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32205-3).
- 📐 [GRmetrics R package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GRmetrics.html) - A software package for implementing improved cell viability metrics based on changes in growth-rate due to drug treatment. Based on the work of [Hafner et al. (Nature Methods)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3853)
- 🧮 [GR Calculator](http://www.grcalculator.org) - A user-friendly web extension of the GRmetrics R package, [Clark et al. (BMC Cancer)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-017-3689-3)
- 🧪 [Small Molecule Suite](https://labsyspharm.shinyapps.io/smallmoleculesuite/) - A web tool to help scientists understand the targets of molecular probes, approved drugs, and other drug-like molecules. Based on the work of [Moret et al. (Cell Chemical Biology)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2019.02.018)
